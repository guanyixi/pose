My group is also working to improve the experimental methods and apparatus in high-energy physics, including advancing scientific software and computing and developing fast electronics for highly-parallelized systems that track charged particles at the LHC. I also work to incorporate results and methods from my research at the intersection of AI/ML, physics, data science into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign by developing courses such as Machine Learning for Physics, Instrumentation Physics: Applications of Machine Learning, and Data Analysis for Physics.</div>

He was an Assistant Professor at University of Toronto between 1987-1989. He joined Bilkent University in 1989 and took an early retirement in 2017. He was a Visiting Professor at UC San Diego in 2016-2017. He joined University of Illinois Chicago in 2017 and he is now a professor of electrical and computer engineering. He is also a member of Discovery Partners Institute, Chicago, IL. Together with his Ph.D. student Erzin, he introduced the concept of adaptive prediction and split vector quantization for Line Spectral Frequency representations. This concept was used in ITU speech coding standards including G.729, G.723.1 and GSM EFR. He co-founded a successful startup wideangle OEM smart camera company in 2003: Oncam-Grandeye (ww.oncamgrandeye.com). His group at Bilkent University developed a surveillance camera-based wildfire detection system which is installed in more than 100 locations in Turkey, Cyprus, Singapore, South Korea and the US. He received a best paper award for this work in a meeting organized by UNESCO and Cyprus Presidency of the European Union. TIME Magazine recognized artificial intelligence (AI) based wildfire detection as one of the Best Inventions of 2023. He is the Editor-in-Chief, Signal, Image and Video Processing published by Springer-Nature. He is a Fellow of IEEE.</div>

                    <h5>Background</h5>
                    <p>Wildfires pose an increasingly urgent global threat, as evidenced by recent devastating events in Maui, Hawaii, and across Alaska. To address this challenge, robust and reliable AI-based wildfire detection models are imperative. Our ongoing research has yielded significant advancements in video and image-based wildfire detection and ember detection AI models aimed at early prevention efforts.</p>
                    
                    <div class="pill"></div>
                    <h5>Strategy</h5>
                    <p>Recognizing the computational demands of these models, we propose leveraging Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) due to their proven flexibility and parallel computation advantages. FPGAs serve as efficient hardware accelerators for deploying deep learning models, ensuring timely and accurate wildfire detection.</p>
                    
                    <div class="pill"></div>
                    <h5>Results</h5>
                    <p>To facilitate the integration of our AI detection models onto FPGAs, which have been trained using various frameworks including PyTorch and TensorFlow-Keras, we rely on the pivotal role of hls4ml in implementation. Our project focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of AI models on FPGAs through the utilization of hls4ml, thereby enabling rapid and efficient wildfire detection and prevention strategies.</p>

                    <h5>Background</h5>
                    <p>4D Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D-STEM) is a powerful technique for atomic resolution imaging. One common imaging mode captures 2D diffraction images at each pixel position in real space. The direct electron detectors used can reach 4K resolution at frame rates up to 5000 frames-per-second. This has led to orders of magnitude increase in the volume and velocity of the data collected, creating challenges in how to efficiently extract actionable information.</p>
                    
                    <div class="pill"></div>
                    <h5>Strategy</h5>
                    <p>We propose and demonstrate a machine learning hardware implementation for real-time crystal structure, rotation, and strain detection in 4D-STEM by leveraging a novel deep neural network (DNN) called a cycle-consistent spatial-transforming autoencoder (CC-ST-AE) capable of learning affine transformations on real and simulation data. We then use distillation to train a smaller, quantized, easily-deployable version of the model to enable real-time inference and high throughput.</p>
                    
                    <div class="pill"></div>
                    <h5>Results</h5>
                    <p>We use hls4ml to synthesize the distilled model and optimize the implementation to meet the required latency constraint of 100us. We then integrate the neural network in the readout path of the imaging system onboard a Euresys CoaXPress frame grabber to minimize IO-related overhead. This work provides a proof-of-concept for real-time crystal structure detection in 4D-STEM, significantly increasing the potential for fast materials characterization and discovery.</p>
